# React - Essentials, States, Props, Hooks, etc.

Brief description of your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js installed
- npm or yarn installed

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rachit287/React-Git-Practice-Project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory on your machine:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory

3. Install dependencies (runtime and development): 
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn

## Running the Development Server
Run the following command to start the development server with Vite. Vite is a cutting-edge frontend build tool that leverages Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for near-instantaneous development feedback, allowing developers in the Vue.js and React ecosystems to enjoy rapid iteration and a seamless development experience.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will open your app in your default browser. The development server will watch for changes and automatically update your app.

## Contributing
